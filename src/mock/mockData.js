                    p1: `The Bidding
North should open 1♦ and not 1♠. You do not need to open the major when you are 5-6 as you have spades. You can easily bid spades twice after 1♦ to show your 6-5. If you have a weak hand with 5 hearts and a 6 card minor you might need to open 1♥ as you cannot reverse and this could be your only chance to show the 5 card heart suit. After 1♦ East should make a weak jump overcall and bid 2♥ South bids 3♣ and West should bid to the number of the trumps and bid 4♥ putting maximum pressure on N/S. North should bid 4♠ which must show 5 and South has little option but to repeat the club suit. North is likely to have some clubs due to North’s length in hearts and the opponents bidding to 4♥. North now needs to appreciate the heart void and raise to 6♣. South is unlikely to have points in hearts and therefore you are likely to be playing with a 30 point pack. This means the opponents have 10 points in hearts for no tricks and slam can be made on very little points.

    The Play
West has an easy lead in the ♥A. Declarer trumps in dummy and should make 7♣ easily. Simply play a spade to the King and trump another heart. Now play the ♠A and trump a spade in hand. Now draw trumps and enter dummy with the ♦A and discard a diamond and the last heart on the good spades.

The Bidding
East opens 1♥ and West should 1♠. You should only bid spades when you have a heart fit with a strong hand. With a weak hand you should raise hearts immediately. If partner has a strong hand on those occasions, they can bid 2♠ as a trial bid and then you can get into the spade fit then. East only has 13 points but they have a very nice hand and should either jump to 3♠ or bid 3♦ as a mini splinter if you play them. A 5431 shape plays very well and you should be aggressive in the bidding when you have a fit. The reason they play so well is Declarer can either trump the shortage or set up the 5 card suit. You should also be aggressive when you hold a 5431 shape and partner shows you support for your 4 card suit. After 3♠, West has a simple 4NT  bid and when East shows 0-3 key-cards West should bid 7♠. You do not need to worry about the trump Queen when you have a 10 card fit as the suit is likely to be 2-1.

The Play
North leads the ♦J and the only problem is the spade suit. As you can only pick up a 3-0 break with South you should play the ♠K first. When North shows out you can easily finesse against South’s Queen and claim. Note that hearts only makes 12 tricks as you have a trump loser.

P	1NT	All Pass

The Bidding
West opens 1NT and most players in North seat will bid either showing a long major or 2♠. This will lead to the contract being 2♠ going down one. North should realise if they make 2♠ then E/W will go down 2 in 1NT. This is +200 and a very good score. It is hard to pass 1NT but this is going to be an easy hand if North does.  Also if North does bid to 2♠ then East should know their side has the balance of points and should make a take-out double. This will get E/W to 3♦ which will make ten tricks for +130 to E/W. If East bids then North can assess the situation and come in with spades.

    The Play
In the defence to 1NT South needs to encourage hearts as early as possible. If North does not find the heart switch after taking the spades then East will still make 1NT. North needs to watch the 1st discard from South as this is the most important discard. A lot of players get lazy when they are running their long suit in defence and do not watch until the last discard.
    If North bids and gets left to play in 2♠, East should lead the ♣3. As West opened 1NT they are likely to have at least 1 honour in clubs.

    The Bidding
    East opens 1♠ and South bids 2♥. North has a decision about bidding 3♥ or passing 2♥. Either way East jumps to 4♠ and South ends the auction with a double.

        The Play
    South has a choice of leads between the singleton club or the ♦A. I think the singleton club is the best choice. South has such a strong hand they do not want to make it easy for Declarer to set up tricks if dummy has Qxx or similar in diamonds. If partner has the ♦Q and 3 diamonds are cashing then South will have plenty of time to play diamonds. Declarer wins the club lead and should see that they might be a trick short if the clubs do not break. They need to set up a diamond trick and hope that the ♠8 is an entry. It is best to conceal the location of the ♦Q and lead a low diamond from hand towards dummy. A lot of players will duck this. South should win and needs to find ♠A and another spade to defeat the contract. This defence will take out the entry to dummies diamond and declarer will have a deep club loser. In practice this is a hard defence to find. If South leads the ♦A, they can still defeat the contract by playing ♠A and another. This is possible if North has raised hearts as South will then know that Declarer has a heart void and you want to play as safe as possible and not give up a trick.

P	3♦	P	3NT	All Pass
    The Bidding
    North opens 1♣ and East should make a practical overcall of 1NT. There is no other bid on the hand. You cannot afford to make a take-out double when you are short in one of the unbid majors let alone short in two of the unbid suits. You know partner is going to bid one of these suits and then you are stuck. If you double and then bid No-trumps you are showing stronger than a 1NT overcall. After 1NT West transfers to spades and then bids 3♦. This is game forcing and East has an easy bid of 3NT. West should pass 3NT. They only have 9 HCP and no fit. East has denied 3 spades and has not raised the diamonds. Bidding over 3NT is likely to lead to a minus score so it is best to let partner struggle away in 3NT.

        The Play
    South should lead a club and should choose the ♣7 or ♣8. You need to let partner know that you have nothing in clubs. This way North can switch if they think there is no future in clubs. On this hand North should work out that Declarer is stacked in clubs and should switch to the ♥8. Declarer should play the King and South should duck but encourage. When North gets in with the ♦K they continue another heart and defeat 3NT. A heart lead is very bad.

        The Bidding
        If East opens 1♠ and West bids 1NT North might like to pass at the vul. They cannot double as this is not a penalty double but a take-out double of spades. However this is different to the other hand with the running spades. Your spades are not running. North should double and South will bid 2♣ and North should bid 2♥ which should lead to 4♥.

        The Play
        East leads the ♦A and should find the switch to ♥A and another. With dummy only having 1 spade and 2 diamonds, East should know Declarer is going to need to do a lot of trumping in dummy. If East does not play ♥A and another then Declarer should make 4♥ by trumping 1 spade low and 1 spade with the ♥9. They know West has a doubleton spade otherwise East would rebid 2♠ over the double with a 6 card suit.

            The Bidding
            South should open 2NT and North should bid 3NT. It is unlikely that exactly 2NT will make so you might as well bid 3NT and hope partner has good ♦.

            The Play
            West has a choice of leads between the ♣A and a low club. I am hesitant in leading a low club from this holding vs a 3NT contract as this could be and is the ninth trick. I prefer to lead the ♣A and get a signal from partner. When partner discourages West should switch to the ♥T and wait for partner to get in and return a club. Declarer will have to go one down unless West continues with a club at trick two. If West finds the diamond switch then the contract can go 5 down if Declarer tries to make by putting the ♦K on!

                The Bidding
                North opens 1♦ and South bids 2♣. West as a passed hand should come in with 2♠. North now either doubles or bids 3♥. I think 3♥ should show 5 and double shows 4 hearts. Over the double East should raise to 3♠ as a blocking bid and South has little choice but to bid 3NT. North now needs to appreciate the power of the hand and should bid 4♦. Remember whenever you bid 4 of a minor over partners no-trump call it should be looking for slam and shows a good hand. South now bids 4NT key-card and the good 6♦ is reached.

                    The Play
                If East leads the ♣Q Declarer needs to make sure they cash dummy’s ♥K and then enter hand with a diamond, trump a heart and then draw trumps losing just one spade. On a spade lead and club switch Declarer can get back and forth by trumping spades.
